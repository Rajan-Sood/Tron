# Tron !

My first attempt building a GameEngine and using the OpenGL and LWGL 
library! 

> An idea which started off as a wild goose chase but soon turned into
  my goal and passion.

> I attempted to create my own math library which implements the 
matrices, vectors and other functions to be further used.

> Using my math library and openGL, I created my own effiecient 
  batchrenderer which can render multiple sprites and graphics to the
  screen in a single drawcall.
